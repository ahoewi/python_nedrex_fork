Stable release
--------------

The nedrex package is available on both `pip` and `conda`.

To install nedrex using `pip`, run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install nedrex

This is the preferred method to install nedrex, as the latest stable release is always updated on PyPI first.

Alternatively, if you prefer to use `conda`, run the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install -c bioconda nedrex

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
